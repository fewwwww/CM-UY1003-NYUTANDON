ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS:
    matter: anything occupies space and has mass
    substance: form of matter has definite composition and distinct property
    state of matter: pure/mixture, solid(condensed phases)/liquid(condensed phases, fluids)/gas(fluids)
    atom/Element/molecule: O/O2/H2O
    compounds: two or more elements

    pure substance: cannot be seperated into simpler substances by chemical process
    mixture: two or more substances(retain distinct identities)
        (1) Homogeneous: milk
        (2) Heterogeneous: not uniform throughout

    property of matter: (1) intensive: independent(color)
                        (2) extensive: volume/mass

MEASUREMENT:
    temperature: K = C + 273.15, F = 9C/5 + 32

    add: significant figures after decimal
    multiply: smallest sig fig

    exact num: have infinite num of sig fig 
    accuracy/precision: how close to true value/how close measurements are to each other

    conversion factor: 1in = 2.54cm, 1/2.54

ATOMS/MOLECULES/IONS:
    atomic number(Z): num of protons in nucleus
    electron: equal to num of protons if neutral
    mass number(A): num of protons + num of neutrons
    isotopes: atoms of same element with different A
    A \/
    Z /\

    periodic table: num means Z
        column: groups
            classification: 
                main group: 1, 2, 13–18
                    Alkali metals: 1(except H)
                    Alkaline earth metals: 2
                    Chalcogens: 16
                    Halogens: 17
                    Noble Gases: ·8
                transition metals: 3-13
                inner transition metals: bottom(Lanthanides, Actinides)

        row: periods
        metals/metalloids/nonmetals: lose electrons,good conductor/gain/gain,poor conductor

    molecule: two or more atoms
        diatomic: only two atoms, H2
        polyatomic: more than two atoms, H2O
