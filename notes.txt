ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS:
    matter: anything occupies space and has mass
    substance: form of matter has definite composition and distinct property
    state of matter: pure/mixture, solid(condensed phases)/liquid(condensed phases, fluids)/gas(fluids)
    atom/Element/molecule: O/O2/H2O
    compounds: two or more elements

    pure substance: cannot be seperated into simpler substances by chemical process
    mixture: two or more substances(retain distinct identities)
        (1) Homogeneous: milk
        (2) Heterogeneous: not uniform throughout

    property of matter: (1) intensive: independent(color)
                        (2) extensive: volume/mass

MEASUREMENT:
    temperature: K = C + 273.15, F = 9C/5 + 32

    add: significant figures after decimal
    multiply: smallest sig fig

    exact num: have infinite num of sig fig 
    accuracy/precision: how close to true value/how close measurements are to each other

    conversion factor: 1in = 2.54cm, 1/2.54

ATOMS/MOLECULES/IONS:
    atomic number(Z): num of protons in nucleus
    electron: equal to num of protons
    mass number(A): num of protons + num of neutrons
    isotopes: atoms of same element with different A
    A \/
    Z /\

    periodic table: num means Z
                    row: periods，电子层数
                    column: groups，外层电子数
                        A: main group
                        B: transition group
                    metals/metalloids/nonmetals: ../shining, conductor/..
